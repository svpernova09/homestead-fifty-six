# Support
> Basic plans are not eligible for support. If a release contains a known breaking change the documentation will be updated to notify users of changes or bug fixes.  

Homestead Fifty Six support is available via the Basic + Support Plan. Users will need a GitHub.com account and provide their username in order to be added to the Homestead-Fifty-Six private repository. Support will be handled via GitHub Issues and as needed one on one chat.

## Support Limitations
Due to the amount of underlying technologies involved in virtualizing computers via Vagrant and virtual machine providers Homestead Fifty Six is limited by these applications in what can be accomplished.  Most often workarounds can be found or alternative workflows accomplished however there may be times that support is unable to resolve an issue to do an upstream application issue.
